Backbone.js/RequireJS Template
====================

Basic template for Backbone.js with RequireJS.

Initially this was created to help me learn how to put all of this together properly and eventually will become a base for any suitable projects.

Feel free to fork/clone/use it if you want to.

Note - this doesn't include a router so you will need to add your own.

---------------------

This template uses (all included):
- Backbone.js 0.9.2
- jQuery v1.7.2
- RequireJS 2.0.2
- RequireJS text 2.0.0
- Underscore.js 1.3.3
